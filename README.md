#Description

This is a code showcase of my Replit project - https://replit.com/@YaroslavKozmen1/Telegram-QOTD-rAskReddit#main.py. This is a telegram VK and YouTube video downloader. The bot also features Question Of The Day operation, meaning that each day it gets top upvoted question from r/AskReddit and sends it to chats.  The instructions are in Russian because the bot was created for local group chats.

For correct media download operation requires ffmpeg.
