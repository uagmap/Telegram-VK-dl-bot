# Description

This is a code showcase of my Replit project - https://replit.com/@YaroslavKozmen1/Telegram-QOTD-rAskReddit#main.py. This is a telegram VK and YouTube video downloader. The bot also features Question Of The Day operation, meaning that each day it gets top upvoted question from r/AskReddit and sends it to chats.

# Install
For correct media download operation requires ffmpeg. The only thing it will affect is VK media display in Telegram.

Execute command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
